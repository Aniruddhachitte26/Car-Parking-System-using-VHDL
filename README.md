# Car-Parking-System-using-VHDL
## In this project, VHDL code and waveform simulation required for developing a system for smart parking are provided. This VHDL project presents a Car Parking System in VHDL using Finite State Machine (FSM).

### In the above fig. , simulation output for car entry and exit password requirement the password entered is correct the green LED glows. If the password entered are incorrect red LED glows. The simulation waveform shows the functional operations of the car parkingsystem in VHDL. We can change the VHDL code to increase the blinking period of the Green LED and Red LED. Also, we can change the period of waiting for password being entered in the FSM VHDL code of the car parking system.
